# Vigenere-Cipher

**Vigenère cipher**, type of substitution cipher used for data encryption in which the original plaintext structure is somewhat concealed in the ciphertext by using several different monoalphabetic substitution ciphers rather than just one; the code key specifies which particular substitution is to be employed for encrypting each plaintext symbol. 

In the simplest systems of the Vigenère type, the key is a word or phrase that is repeated as many times as required to encipher a message. 

To encipher a message, the letters of the plaintext are changed according to the letters of the key. The alphabetical position of the letters in plaintext are correspondingly increased by the alphabetical position of the letters in the key. 

The resulting positions are for the new letters that will form the cipher.
